## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

I learned about React more specifically React hooks,map function and how to pass on props in functional components!

### Continued development

I would like to work more on React as i am not yet fully comfortable with working with different components and how to pass in props and i would like to explore on more challenges to fully understant the different react hooks

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XN5elYWiSuw) - This helped me understand how to fully write code application and i started recognising repeated patterns in how to solve real life problems
